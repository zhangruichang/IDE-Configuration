    getch() -> key character
    
    Read a keypress and return the resulting character. Nothing is echoed to
    the console. This call will block if a keypress is not already
    available, but will not wait for Enter to be pressed. If the pressed key
    was a special function key, this will return '\000' or '\xe0'; the next
    call will return the keycode. The Control-C keypress cannot be read with
    this function.

    a printable character.

    the current file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond
    the end of the file. mode must be one of the LK_* constants listed
    below. Multiple regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but
